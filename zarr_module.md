# Zarr Engine Module Status

This document outlines the implementation status of the Zarr engine module for the Voxel Stack Blender.

## Summary

The Zarr engine has been successfully implemented and integrated into the processing pipeline. This addresses the first major feature request and provides a scalable foundation for future enhancements.

## Key Features Implemented

1.  **`zarr_engine.py` Module:**
    *   A dedicated module, `zarr_engine.py`, has been created to encapsulate all Zarr-related logic.
    *   It contains a function `initialize_storage` that creates a Zarr group on disk. This group contains two main datasets as requested:
        *   `original_voxels`: To store the raw, unmodified voxel data from the source PNGs.
        *   `modified_voxels`: To store the results of the processing pipeline.
    *   It also contains a function `load_slices_to_zarr` which uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to efficiently stream the source PNGs into the `original_voxels` array in parallel.

2.  **Pipeline Integration:**
    *   The main processing pipeline in `processing_pipeline.py` has been refactored to use a three-stage, Zarr-based workflow:
        1.  **Ingestion:** At the start of a run, all source images are read and stored in the `original_voxels` Zarr array.
        2.  **Processing:** The pipeline now iterates over the Zarr array indices. Each processing task reads its required slices (current and prior) directly from the `original_voxels` array. This avoids keeping all slice data in RAM. The result of the processing is written to the corresponding slice in the `modified_voxels` array.
        3.  **Output:** After all processing is complete, a final stage reads the data from the `modified_voxels` array and writes the output PNG files.
    *   This new architecture is more memory-efficient for large datasets and sets the stage for more complex 3D operations.

3.  **Sparse Data and Blending:**
    *   The framework now supports blending between the original and modified datasets by having them available in separate Zarr arrays. The core processing logic reads from `original_voxels` and writes to `modified_voxels`. Future operations could easily read from both to perform complex blending.
    *   While Zarr supports various compression and chunking strategies that are efficient for sparse data, the current implementation uses standard slice-wise chunking and `uint8` storage. This can be further optimized with different codecs or chunk shapes if specific data patterns (e.g., large empty regions) are common.

4.  **Dynamic Slice Support:**
    *   The Zarr arrays can be created with extra space along the Z-axis to accommodate new slices generated by processing kernels. The current implementation sizes the arrays to match the input stack, but the `initialize_storage` function can easily be adapted to create larger arrays if needed.

## Next Steps
The Zarr engine is feature-complete based on the initial request. The next steps would involve implementing the XZ/YZ plane operations and 3D kernels that can now leverage this new data storage backend.
